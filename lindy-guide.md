#### **3\. Configuring AI Agents**

AI agents are the core of Lindy’s automation capabilities. To configure an AI agent:

*   Assign a task or purpose (e.g., managing a calendar).
*   Select the AI model to power the agent, such as GPT-4 Turbo or Claude.
*   Define skills and permissions, such as creating or modifying calendar events.

#### **4\. Testing and Deploying**

Once your automation is built:

*   Test it to ensure it functions as expected.
*   Deploy it to handle tasks automatically.

* * *

### **Example Use Case: Calendar Management Bot**

1.  **Objective**: Create a bot that manages your calendar by observing, creating, and updating events.
2.  **Steps**:
    *   Define the bot’s purpose: “You are a calendar management bot. Manage events for \[User\].”
    *   Assign skills: Access Google Calendar, check for conflicts, and suggest optimal scheduling times.
    *   Set up triggers: Respond to messages like “Add a meeting at 3 PM” by automatically updating the calendar.
3.  **Outcome**: The bot autonomously manages your schedule, ensuring no conflicts and optimal time management.
