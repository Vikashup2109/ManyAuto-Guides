## What is Zapier?

Zapier is an online platform that allows you to automate tasks between different apps. For example, you can:

- Automatically save email attachments to Google Drive.
- Add new leads from a form to your CRM.
- Notify your team on Slack when a new task is created in your project management tool.

These automations are called **Zaps**.

## Key Concepts

- **Zap**: An automated workflow that connects two or more apps.
- **Trigger**: The event that starts a Zap (e.g., receiving a new email).
- **Action**: The task that happens as a result of the trigger (e.g., saving the email attachment to Google Drive).
- **Task**: Each step in a Zap is counted as a task.
