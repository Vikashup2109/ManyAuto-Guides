Beginner's Guide to Using ManyChat in 2024

Introduction

In this guide, I will show you how to use ManyChat in 2024. I have personally used this tool to grow my clients' Instagram accounts and generate thousands of leads for them. By the end of this guide, you will understand what ManyChat is, why you should use it, the four main concepts of ManyChat, and how to create your first automation to generate leads on autopilot. One of my clients used a similar automation to generate over 2,000 leads from Instagram—and I’ll provide you with the exact template for free.

Let’s get started!

What is ManyChat?

ManyChat is a chat automation platform that allows you to automate Instagram DMs. This means that whenever someone sends you a message on Instagram, replies to one of your stories, or comments on a post, ManyChat can automatically respond or start a conversation for you.

Using ManyChat, you can:

Increase engagement on your Instagram account.

Expand your reach.

Generate leads 24/7 on autopilot.

The best part? Around 90% of Instagram accounts are not yet using this tool, giving you a significant competitive advantage.

Getting Started

Sign Up for ManyChat

Visit ManyChat’s website.

Click “Get Started” and select Instagram as your platform.

Follow the steps to connect your Instagram account to ManyChat. Ensure you have admin access to your business account.

Explore the Dashboard

Once connected, log in to ManyChat. Your dashboard includes:

Contacts: Manage and track users interacting with your account.

Automation: Design workflows and automate messages.

Live Chat: Manually manage conversations when needed.

Broadcasting: Send messages to specific audience segments.

Settings: Customize your chatbot and manage integrations.

Four Main Concepts of ManyChat

1. Contacts

Contacts in ManyChat represent all the people interacting with your Instagram account. For example, anyone who sends a message, replies to a story, or comments on a post becomes a contact.

You can filter contacts based on criteria like “emails collected” or “specific interactions.”

View individual profiles to see custom fields, conversation history, and user input.

To see contacts, go to the Contacts tab in the dashboard. You can:

Filter by criteria such as users who have shared their email addresses.

Look up specific contacts by name and view detailed interaction history.

2. Fields

Fields store user data collected during interactions. ManyChat has two types of fields:

System Fields: Built-in fields like first name, last name, and email.

Custom Fields: Fields you create to store specific data (e.g., interests or preferences).

For example, you can create a custom field to store user responses to questions like "What’s your favorite product?" and integrate this data with a CRM or email marketing platform.

To manage fields, go to the Settings > Fields section, where you can:

View and edit existing fields.

Create new fields to store specific data.

3. Automation

Automation is the heart of ManyChat. It’s where workflows are created and managed to:

Automatically respond to comments, DMs, and story interactions.

Guide users through multi-step conversations.

You’ll spend most of your time in the Automation tab, which allows you to:

Build workflows from scratch or use templates.

Organize automations into folders for easy management.

For example, create an automation that responds to a comment with a direct message offering a free guide.

4. Live Chat

Live Chat allows you to:

Handle conversations not addressed by automation.

Pause automations for manual replies.

Assign conversations to team members.

Use the Live Chat tab to:

Monitor and manage ongoing interactions.

Take over conversations that require a human touch.

Setting Up Your ManyChat Account

Adjust Live Chat Behavior

Go to Settings > Live Chat Behavior:

Default Setting: Any message starts a conversation. This can overwhelm your team.

Recommended Setting: Set conversations to open explicitly. This lets you control when to manually intervene.

Enable automation pauses for 24 hours after a manual reply to avoid interference.

Set a Default Reply

Navigate to Instagram > Default Reply:

Create a fallback automation for untriggered queries.

Mark the conversation as open.

Assign it to a team member.

Notify your team of new queries.

Creating Your First Automation: Lead Generation Funnel

Let’s build a simple lead generation funnel that collects names and emails in exchange for a free guide or ebook.

Create a New Automation

Go to Automation > New Automation.

Choose “Start from Scratch.”

Add Triggers

Trigger 1: Respond to comments containing specific words like “guide.”

Add public replies to boost engagement (e.g., “Check your DMs for the guide!”).

Trigger 2: Respond to DMs with specific keywords like “guide.”

Build the Flow

First Message:

Send: “Are you ready to get the guide? Click below.”

Add a button labeled “Yes, send it!”

Collect Name:

Use a User Input field: “What’s your first name?”

Set reply type to “First Name” and disable the skip option.

Collect Email:

Use another User Input field: “What’s your email address?”

Set reply type to “Email.” ManyChat validates email formats automatically.

Deliver Lead Magnet:

Send a final message: “Here’s your free guide. Click below to access it.”

Add a button linking to the guide.

Test Your Automation

Test the flow by commenting or messaging your Instagram account with trigger words.

Ensure responses and lead collection work as expected.

Advanced Features

Integrations

ManyChat integrates with tools like:

Email Marketing Platforms: MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit.

Google Sheets: Export collected data automatically.

For example, when a user provides their email, you can:

Add an action to send the data to MailChimp.

Automatically add the contact to a specific email list.

Analytics

Track performance metrics:

Open Rates.

Click-Through Rates.

Engagement Metrics.

Use these insights to optimize workflows and improve user experience.
