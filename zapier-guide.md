## Key Concepts

### Zap
A Zap is an automated workflow that connects two or more apps. Zaps consist of Triggers and Actions.

### Trigger
A Trigger is an event in one app that starts the Zap. For example, "New Email in Gmail" could be a trigger.

### Action
An Action is the task that happens as a result of the trigger. For instance, "Save Attachment in Google Drive".

### Task
Each step in a Zap is called a task. For example, saving a file or sending an email counts as one task.

### Multi-Step Zaps
These are Zaps that include more than one Action. For example, after saving an email attachment to Google Drive, you can notify your team via Slack.
