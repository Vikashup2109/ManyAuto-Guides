## 1. What is ManyChat?  
**Think of it as your Instagram assistant** that:  
- **Automatically replies** to DMs and comments.  
- **Collects leads** (emails, phone numbers) 24/7.  
- **Sends broadcasts** (bulk messages) to followers.  
- **Tracks interactions** (e.g., who opened your messages).  

**Why it’s powerful**:  
- **90% of Instagram users don’t use bots** → You’ll stand out.  
- **Saves 10+ hours/week** on repetitive tasks.

## 3. Understanding Contacts, Fields & Tags  

### Contacts  
- **Where to find them**: Go to the **Contacts** tab.  
- **Filter contacts** by:  
  - **Tags**: E.g., “Lead,” “Customer,” “Interested in Discounts.”  
  - **Custom Fields**: E.g., “Email = [blank]” to find contacts without emails.  

### Fields  
- **System Fields** (Auto-collected):  
  - Name, Instagram username, phone number (if shared).  
- **Custom Fields** (Create your own):  
  - Example: “Budget,” “Favorite Product,” “Signup Date.”  
  - **How to add**:  
    1. Go to **Contacts** → **Fields**.  
    2. Click **+ New Custom Field**.  

### Tags  
- Use tags to **organize contacts** (e.g., tag users who clicked a link or downloaded a guide).  
- **Pro Tip**: Automatically add tags when users trigger specific actions (e.g., commenting “FREEBIE”).

## 4. Building Automations (With Examples)  

### Example 1: Lead Generation Funnel  
**Goal**: Collect emails by offering a free resource (e.g., PDF, discount code).  

**Step 1: Create a Trigger**  
- Go to **Automations** → **+ New Automation**.  
- Choose **Trigger**:  
  - **Keyword**: User comments “FREE GUIDE” on a post.  
  - **Direct Message**: User sends a DM with “YES.”  

**Step 2: Design the Flow**  
1. **Send a DM**: “What’s your name?” → Save reply to the **Name** field.  
2. **Ask for Email**: “What’s your email?” → Save to **Email** field.  
3. **Deliver the Resource**: Send a DM with a link to the PDF.  
4. **Tag the User**: Add a tag like “Lead – Free Guide.”  

**Step 3: Add a Fallback**  
- If the user doesn’t reply, send a follow-up: “Still want the guide? Type YES!”  

### Example 2: Customer Support Automation  
**Goal**: Answer FAQs automatically (e.g., “Where’s my order?”).  

1. **Trigger**: Keyword “TRACK ORDER.”  
2. **Send a DM**: “Please share your order number.”  
3. **Integrate with Shopify**: Fetch tracking info automatically.  
4. **Handoff to Live Chat**: If the bot can’t resolve the issue, assign it to your team.

## 5. Live Chat vs. Automation  

- **Use Automation For**:  
  - Repetitive tasks (e.g., FAQs, lead collection).  
  - After-hours replies.  

- **Use Live Chat For**:  
  - Complex issues (e.g., complaints, custom requests).  
  - Building personal relationships with VIP customers.  

**Pro Tip**: Use the **Live Chat Inbox** to prioritize urgent messages (flag them as “High Priority”).

## 6. Integrations  

### Google Sheets  
1. Go to **Integrations** → **Google Sheets**.  
2. Connect your account.  
3. **Automatically add new leads** to a spreadsheet.  

```markdown
Example Google Sheets automation rule:  
- Trigger: New contact added  
- Action: Append row to Sheet → Name, Email, Date  
```

### Email Marketing (MailChimp)  
1. Connect **MailChimp** under **Integrations**.  
2. Set a rule: When a user provides an email → Add them to your “Instagram Leads” list.  

### Zapier  
- Connect to 5,000+ apps (e.g., Slack, Trello). Example:  
  - Trigger: New ManyChat lead → Send a Slack notification to your team.

## 7. Pro Tips & Mistakes to Avoid  

### Do’s  
- **Test Every Automation**: Send yourself DMs to check replies.  
- **Use Quick Replies**: Add buttons like “Yes/No” to simplify user responses.  
- **Segment Audiences**: Send targeted broadcasts (e.g., only to users who opened a previous message).  

### Don’ts  
- **Spam Users**: Avoid sending too many messages (Instagram may ban your account).  
- **Ignore Analytics**: Check ManyChat’s **Dashboard** to see open rates, block rates, and drop-offs.  

---

## Troubleshooting  
- **Automation Not Working?**  
  - Check if triggers are spelled correctly (e.g., “FREE GUIDE” vs. “Free guide”).  
  - Ensure your Instagram account is connected.  
- **Broadcasts Failed to Send?**  
  - You might have hit Instagram’s message limits (avoid sending 100+ DMs/hour).  

---

## Next Steps  
1. Start with **ONE simple automation** (e.g., reply to comments with “FREE”).  
2. Gradually add tags, fields, and integrations.  
3. Use broadcasts to re-engage inactive followers.
